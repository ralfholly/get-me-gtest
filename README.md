# GET ME GTEST

## Description
A little tool that fetches Google Test (which includes Google Mock as well) from the GitHub servers and builds it for you

## Dependencies
Make sure `cmake` is installed. Otherwise, only basic tools found on every Unix/Linux system are required, eg. `make`, `wget`.

## Usage
```
make VERSION=release-1.8.0   # Fetches release 1.8.0 and builds it.
make list                    # Shows a list of versions available.
```
